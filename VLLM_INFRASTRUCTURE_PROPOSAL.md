# 🚀 vLLM Infrastructure Proposal for Transosonde

## Executive Summary

This proposal outlines establishing **vLLM as a shared infrastructure service** across transosonde projects. Rather than each project implementing custom inference optimization, we should provide vLLM as a centralized, scalable service that delivers 10-20x performance improvements for LLM workloads.

## Business Case

### Current State: Project-Level Optimization
- Each project reinvents inference optimization
- Dependency conflicts waste engineering time
- Inconsistent performance across projects
- Limited scalability and resource sharing

### Proposed State: Centralized vLLM Service
- **10-20x performance improvements** across all LLM projects
- **Consistent dependency management** handled centrally
- **Shared GPU resources** with automatic scaling
- **Standardized APIs** for seamless integration

### Impact Example (This Project)
- **Before**: Remote API at 7 tokens/sec → 20+ hour experiments
- **After**: vLLM at 140+ tokens/sec → 6.2 hour experiments
- **ROI**: 3.2x faster time-to-insights across all LLM research

services:
  vllm-router:
    image: nginx:alpine
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf

### 3. Client Integration

#### Python Client Library
```python
# transosonde_vllm_client.py
import requests
from typing import List, Dict, Any

class TransosondeVLLM:
    def __init__(self, base_url: str = "http://vllm.transosonde.internal"):
        self.base_url = base_url

    def complete(self, prompt: str, model: str = "qwen-7b", **kwargs) -> str:
        """OpenAI-compatible completion endpoint."""
        response = requests.post(f"{self.base_url}/v1/completions", json={
            "model": model,
            "prompt": prompt,
            "max_tokens": kwargs.get("max_tokens", 256),
            "temperature": kwargs.get("temperature", 0.0)
        })
        return response.json()["choices"][0]["text"]

    def batch_complete(self, prompts: List[str], **kwargs) -> List[str]:
        """Efficient batch processing."""
        # Implement concurrent requests or native batch API
        pass
```

#### Easy Integration Pattern
```python
# In any transosonde project
from transosonde_vllm import TransosondeVLLM

llm = TransosondeVLLM()
result = llm.complete("Explain quantum computing in one sentence.")
```
